Poli 179 Final Project
By Omar Romero Godoy and Logan De La Torre

	For our project, we looked at tweets from Islamic State extremist supporters in the span of 2014-2016. Our research question is "How do counter-extremism efforts influence the evolution of extremist rhetoric on social media platforms?" The dataset we used is by Tamar Mitts, and utilizes R.Data files as stored data. 

	For our research, we are utilizing word embeddings with the hope to have vector representations of the text data. We will then also use LDA topic clustering to identify and compare the main topics that IS members discuss before and after counter-extremism efforts. Our hope is that by the end of the research project, we can see if there are any trends of what topics IS members discuss after counter-extremism efforts, and see what impact counter-extremism events have. For context, counter-extremism efforts were events held by the US government in order to lower the potential threats of Islamic State supporters.
	
	The main issue we had was accessing the data. The dataset we used was over 2.5 gb long, and when we finally successfully loaded it up into google drive and our collab, we ended up seeing that Mittâ€™s data is preprocessed, and she does not save the tweets, rather saves the overall results for every tweet. We were able to make a base code to hopefully speed up the process of the word embeddings and the topic clustering, and once we are able to get the tweets in our code, we will be able to quickly do the other parts.
